<h3>
	Guide to installing the Weka Package via the SimpleCLI
</h3>
<pre>
After the Weka program has started, the 'RSARSubsetEval' Weka package can be installed.

1. Click the 'SimpleCLI' button, to open the Weka simple command line interface.
2. Paste in the following command, and press Enter:  (where X:\path\to\weka\package\download\ = the path to the downloaded plugin)

	java weka.core.WekaPackageManager -install-package X:\path\to\weka\package\download\RSARSubsetEval.zip

3. After installation, check the package installed correctly, paste in the following, and press Enter.
	(this can also be checked via the Weka PackageManager)

	java weka.core.WekaPackageManager -package-info installed RSARSubsetEval

4. To use the package from within Weka, close the Weka software, and then re-open Weka.
5. To uninstall the package:

	java weka.core.WekaPackageManager -uninstall-package RSARSubsetEval

<div class="content">
<p>
The software plugin is for the opensource data mining Weka application. The plugin was built as part of my undergraduate dissertation project at the 
Department of Computer Science in Aberystwyth, Wales. The project was supervised by Dr. Richard Jensen.
</p>
<p>
The plugin algorithm is an implementation of the rough set attribute reduction (RSAR) algorithm presented by A. Chouchoulas and Q. Shen in their 2001 paper: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.icsa.inf.ed.ac.uk/publications/online/0121.pdf">Rough Set-Aided Keyword Reduction for Text Categorisation.</a> This is a feature selection algorithm used to select the attributes of most importance.
</p>
<p>
The plugin was built and validated against high dimensionality gene expression datasets from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rsctc2010.org/challenge/challenge.html">RSCTC 2010 Discovery Challenge conference competition.</a>
The datasets tested were classified, continuous-valued, and had 25k-54k attributes with only &lt;80 objects. Datasets were prepared from microarray experiments on patients suffering from cancers. Specifically under analysis were transcription profiles of human gliomas (<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-GEOD-4290/">E-GEOD-4290</a>) and of gingival tissue (<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-GEOD-10334/">E-GEOD-10334</a>).
